# Prime-Number-Factorization
Have you ever wanted to divide a number by prime numbers? Look no more!
The file is only around 2 kb, and contains all the prime numbers from 1 to 1000. If you are interested in using higher numbers, just add them in the "prime" section at the end.

**PS:** Don't forget to add a comma ( , ) between the numbers if you were to add anything.
Enjoy!
